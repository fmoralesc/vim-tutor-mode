**NOTE: This plugin has been incorporated into neovim's codebase and might soon
be added to vim. The purpose of this standalone evrsion of the plugin was to be
a testbed of the idea, and since it has accomplished its purpose, I am
archiving the repository.**

is suggested.

add the following to your `vimrc`.

Otherwise copy this repository's contents to your `~/.vim` folder.

This plugin is only available if `'compatible'` is not set.
