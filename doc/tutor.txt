- USAGE                                                      *vim-tutor-usage*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

vim-tutor-mode tutorials are hypertext documents, that is, they have rich text
and contain links. To stand out from the rest of the text, links are
underlined. You can follow them by placing the cursor over them and pressing
<Enter>, or by double-clicking them. Most of the links will open vim's help
system, but some will move you around the document itself.
