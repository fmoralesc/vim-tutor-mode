                                VIM-TUTOR-MODE

vim-tutor-mode provides a system to create and follow interactive tutorials
for vim and third party plugins. It replaces the venerable `vimtutor` system.

- USAGE                                                      *vim-tutor-usage*

vim-tutor-mode tutorials are hypertext documents, that is, they have rich text
and contain links. To stand out from the rest of the text, links are
underlined. You can follow them by placing the cursor over them and pressing
<Enter>, or by double-clicking them. Most of the links will open vim's help
system, but some will move you around the document itself.

- COMMANDS                                                  *:VimTutor* *:Tutor*

:Tutor {tutorial}           Opens a tutorial.
			    If no arguments are provided, it opens the
			    '01-vim-beginner' tutorial, which is equivalent to
			    Vim's vimtutor.

- CREATING                                                  *vim-tutor-create*
